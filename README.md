### Usage

#### Key management

mungectl can be used to manage the MUNGE key file shared between all the nodes in your
HPC cluster using the `key` subcommand:

```shell
mungectl key generate               # Generate new munge key file.
mungectl key get                    # Get munge key file as base64-encoded string.
cat new.key.b64 | mungectl key set  # Set new munge key using base64-encoded key.
```
